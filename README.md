## Featured Projects

### ðŸ”¬ Biomedical Research PDF-to-JSON Converter  
**Tech:** Python, GROBID, Docling, LLMSherpa, LangChain, Instructor, Pydantic, Groq API, FastAPI  

**Highlights:**
- Converted biomedical research PDFs into structured JSON using a hybrid extraction pipeline combining **GROBID** (TEI XML), **LLMSherpa** (section segmentation), and **Docling** (fallback logic).
- Isolated key sections (e.g., *Methods*, *Results*, *Discussions* and *Tables* with captions and footnotes) via heuristic matching, regex-enhanced parsing and semantic matching for robust segmentation of sections

### Uber Driver Allocation Optimization
**Tech:** Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP, Matplotlib  
**Highlights:**
- Built tree-based models to improve offer acceptance rates in a 2-sided platform.
- Reduced false positive rate (FPR) by 7% through pruning and ensemble tuning.
- Evaluated using PR AUC, precision/recall, confusion matrices.
